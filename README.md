Using Pytorch library we trained a model to classify a speech command using speech data(1sec audio word). The provided dataset contains 30 different categories of commands. our task was to train a classifier that classifies this data.

The Gcommand_loader Class enable to crate a picture from the audio(.wav) that represent the evolution of the frequency over the time (shade of gray pixels). we used the Google Collab GPU to train our model. Link to download the data on google Collab : !tar -xvzf ./gdrive/My\ Drive/data.tar.gz
